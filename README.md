# Robotic-Arm-Project:

This project aims at encouraging students interested in building the MeArm robotic arm. The repository is equipped with all the open source tools that are required to build a 3 degrees of freedom robotic arm.

This repository consists of two subdirectories

- Images

- manipulator

**Images:**
This folder consists of images of 3D model of robot and drafted 2D drawings of robot

**manipulator:**
This folder consists of 3D models of individual parts of the robotic arm.All these models were created in Solidworks 3D modeling softwares.

The robotic arm is built using resources from MeArm opensource project.For more information on MeArm robot check out
